# SauceNao-Windows
Use SauceNao in Windows natively.

What it does
------------
I needed something like [Image Search Options](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/image-search-options/?src=userprofile) for the images I have already saved in my computer but I didn't found any client, so here we have a [SauceNAO](http://saucenao.com) client for Windows.

Usage
-----
`> SauceNao-Windows.exe <SAUCENAO_API_KEY> <IMGUR_API_KEY> <IMAGE_PATH> [PROXY IP:PORT]`

Bind to the right-click
-----------------------
In order to SauceNAO an image from your local filesystem, just set the correct variable inside `regedit.bat` and then run it as administrator.
